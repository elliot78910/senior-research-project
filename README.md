# Senior Research Project

## Goal:

The goal of this project is to find out what cites/locations in the United States have more
remote-work opportunities avaliable for software engineers. Post-covid, many jobs have switched
over to working remotely or from home, rather than from in the office. This leads many people
to desire these jobs over in-person ones, and vice-versa. My goal is to allow people to have
more information on where each type of job is more likely to be located.
